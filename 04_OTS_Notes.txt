These playbooks deploy and configure ONTAP Select to support the lab infrastructure.

Prerequisits:
1. Ansible 2.8
2. The ONTAP Select Single node eval OVA, which can be downloaded from the evaluation center on the mysupport site.  
   (i.e. 9.5_DataONTAPv-esx-standalone-nodar.ova )


Optional:
If an NLF key is avilable, modify the serial number embedded within the OVF file to match the serial number in the NLF file.
1. Extract the OVA (with any tool that can extract tar archives)
2. Delete the .mf file
3. Edit the OVF file, replacing the serial number as required

Deploying ONTAP Select:
1. Customize the vars.yml as required
2. Run the Deploy playbook:
     ansible-playbook 04_OTS_Deploy.yml
3. Run the Configure playbook:
     ansible-playbook 04_OTS_Configure.yml

Note:
   It can take 5 minutes or more for the ONTAP Select VM to initialize after running the deploy playbook.  Monitor the VM
   Console and wait for the login prompt before running the configure playbook.
